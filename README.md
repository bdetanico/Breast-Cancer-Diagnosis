# Project: Breast Cancer Diagnosis - EDA and Machine Learning

The dataset, found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29, consists of features which were computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) procedure of breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus. The following nuclear features were analyzed:

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The dataset has the following attribute information:

**(a) Number of instances: 569**

**(b) Number of attributes: 32**

Breast cancer is the most-common invasive cancer in women and affect about 12% of women worldwide (McGuire, A; Brown, JA; Malone, C; McLaughlin, R; Kerin, MJ (22 May 2015). "Effects of age on the detection and management of breast cancer". Cancers. 7 (2): 908â€“29. doi:10.3390/cancers7020815).

The fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedure helps establish the breast cancer diagnosis. Together physical examination of breasts and mammography, FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.

A well-described characteristics in terms of the cell nuclei through digitized image, including the establishment of patterns/models, can helps improve breast cancer diagnosis.

**Objective**: Analyse cell nuclei characteristics, and if possible, identify patterns related to the diagnosis of breast tissues (malignant or benign). Additionally, it will be proposed a machine learning models for diagnosis.
